### PROJECT TITLE:

# "SECURE BACKEND AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM": 

### DESCRIPTION:

A secure Node.js backend application implementing authentication, JWT authorization, password hashing, security headers, logging, and basic penetration testing simulation.

### FEATURES:

1- User Registration with validation

2- Secure Password Hashing using bcrypt

3- JWT-based Authentication

4- Protected Routes

5- Security Headers using Helmet

6- Logging using Winston

7- Basic Penetration Testing Simulation (Nmap)

### TECHNOLOGIES USED:

1- Node.js

2- Express.js

3- bcrypt

4- jsonwebtoken

5- helmet

6- winston

7- validator

8- Security Features 

9- Input validation

10- Password hashing & salting

11- JWT token verification

12- Security logging

13- Basic port scanning using Nmap

### HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:

=> npm install
=> node server.js

Server runs on:
http://localhost:3000

### PENETRATION TETSING:

1- Used Nmap to scan open ports

2- Verified server is running on port 3000

3- Confirmed no unnecessary ports exposed

### LOGGING:

=> Winston configured

=> Logs saved in security.log

=> Logs application start & security events
